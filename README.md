tslint-react
------------

Lint rules related to React & JSX for [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/).

### Usage

Sample configuration where `tslint.json` lives adjacent to your `node_modules` folder:

```js
{
  "extends": ["tslint:latest", "tslint-react"],
  "rules": {
    // enable tslint-react rules here
    "jsx-no-lambda": true
  }
}
```

### Rules

- `jsx-alignment`
  - Enforces a consistent style for multiline JSX elements which promotes ease of editing via line-wise manipulations
  as well as maintainabilty via small diffs when changes are made.
  ```ts
  // Good:
  const element = <div
      className="foo"
      tabIndex={1}
  >
      {children}
  </div>;

  // Also Good:
  <Button
      appearance="pretty"
      disabled
      label="Click Me"
      size={size}
  />
  ```
- `jsx-curly-spacing` (since v1.1.0)
  - Requires _or_ bans spaces between curly brace characters in JSX.
  - Rule options: `["always", "never"]`
- `jsx-no-lambda`
  - Creating new anonymous functions (with either the `function` syntax or ES2015 arrow syntax) inside the `render` call stack works against _pure component rendering_. When doing an equality check between two lambdas, React will always consider them unequal values and force the component to re-render more often than necessary.
  - Rule options: _none_
- `jsx-no-multiline-js`
  - Disallows multiline JS expressions inside JSX blocks to promote readability
  - Rule options: _none_
- `jsx-no-string-ref`
  - Passing strings to the `ref` prop of React elements is considered a legacy feature and will soon be deprecated.
    Instead, [use a callback](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html#the-ref-callback-attribute).
  - Rule options: _none_
- `jsx-self-close` (since v0.4.0)
  - Enforces that JSX elements with no children are self-closing.
  ```ts
  // bad
  <div className="foo"></div>
  // good
  <div className="foo" />
  ```
  - Rule options: _none_
- `jsx-wrap-multiline` (since v2.1)
  - Enforces that multiline JSX expressions are wrapped with parentheses.
  - Opening parenthesis must be followed by a newline.
  - Closing parenthesis must be preceded by a newline.
  ```ts
  // bad
  const button = <button type="submit">
      Submit
  </button>;
  // good
  const button = (
      <button type="submit">
          Submit
      </button>
  );
  ```

### Development

We track rule suggestions on Github issues -- [here's a useful link](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Rule+Suggestion%22) to view all the current suggestions. Tickets are roughly triaged by priority (P1, P2, P3).

We're happy to accept PRs for new rules, especially those marked as [Status: Accepting PRs](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Status%3A+Accepting+PRs%22). If submitting a PR, try to follow the same style conventions as the [core TSLint project](https://github.com/palantir/tslint).
